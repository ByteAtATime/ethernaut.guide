In this challenge, you need to exploit the `Token` contract to gain more tokens than you should be allowed to have.

## Hints

<Hint index={1}>
    The `Token` contract has a transfer function that allows token transfers between addresses. Look closely at the conditions and arithmetic operations in this function. How does it handle balances and overflows?
</Hint>

<Hint index={2}>
    Notice how this contract is compiled with a Solidity version before 0.8.0. How do arithmetic operations behave in this version, and what vulnerabilities can arise from this behavior?
</Hint>

<Hint index={3}>
    Consider the behavior of unsigned integers in previous versions of Solidity. What happens when an unsigned integer is decreased below zero? How does this affect the balances in the `Token` contract?
</Hint>

## Solution

<Solution>
    The `Token` contract's `transfer` function does not properly handle underflow conditions. Here's the relevant part of the contract:

    ```solidity
    function transfer(address _to, uint _value) public returns (bool) {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _value);
        balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
        balances[_to] += _value;
        return true;
    }
    ```

    In Solidity versions before 0.8.0, arithmetic operations on unsigned integers do not revert on overflow or underflow. This means if `balances[msg.sender]` is less than `_value`, subtracting `_value` will underflow and wrap around to a very large number.

    To exploit this, you can call the `transfer` function with a value greater than your current balance, causing an underflow and resulting in a large balance.

    Here are the steps to exploit the contract:

    1. Check your current balance with `token.balanceOf(yourAddress)`.
    2. Call the `transfer` function with a value greater than your current balance, e.g., `await token.transfer(anyAddress, yourBalance + 1)`.

    This will underflow your balance, giving you a large amount of tokens.
</Solution>

## Conclusion

<Conclusion>
    <Fragment slot="takeaways">
        This challenge demonstrates the importance of handling integer underflow and overflow correctly in Solidity. Key takeaways include:

        1. **Integer Overflow/Underflow**: Before Solidity 0.8.0, arithmetic operations did not revert on overflow or underflow, which could lead to serious vulnerabilities.
        2. **SafeMath Library**: Always use libraries like OpenZeppelin's SafeMath to perform safe arithmetic operations that prevent overflow and underflow.
        3. **Proper Validation**: Ensure all arithmetic operations are properly validated and consider edge cases where underflow or overflow could occur.

        These lessons are crucial for developing secure smart contracts and preventing common vulnerabilities.

    <Fragment slot="hacks">
        A famous example of an integer underflow exploit is the Proof of Weak Hands (PoWH) Ponzi scheme, where attackers drained the contract by exploiting an underflow vulnerability in the `approve` function.
