In this challenge, you have to take ownership of the `Fallback` contract.

## Hints

<Hint index={1}>
    To take ownership, you have to set the `owner` field to your address. Is there any functions that set this? What are
    the conditions to invoke those functions?

    (Bonus hint: there are 2 ways, but one of them is really stupid).
</Hint>

<Hint index={2}>
    The special `receive()` function is called when a contract receives a transaction without any data. This is
    sometimes known as a fallback function (along with the function named `fallback()`).

    This challenge is named "Fallback" for a reason. What can you do with the `receive()` function?
</Hint>

<Hint index="3">
    There are two conditions to call the `receive()` function:
    1. Your contribution amount must be greater than 0.
    2. The amount of ether sent must be greater than 0.

    How do you satisfy these conditions?
</Hint>

## Solution

<Solution>
    The `Fallback` contract has a `receive()` function that is called when it receives ether without any data. This
    function sets the `owner` to `msg.sender`, but only when the player contributes a positive amount.

    In order to send a contribution, you call the aptly-named `contribute()` function with a very small (&lt;0.001
    ether) amount.

    Then, we can send a transaction to the contract with a another small value. This will trigger the `receive()`
    function, which will set the `owner` to our address.
</Solution>

## Conclusion

<Conclusion>
    <Fragment slot="takeaways">
        This challenge is a good introduction to the Ethernaut challenges. There are a few things it introduces:

        1. The `receive()` function, which is called when a contract receives ether without any data.
        2. That you shouldn't allow anyone to take ownership of your contract without your consent.
        3. Finding the right conditions to trigger a function.

        These are all important concepts that you will see in future challenges.
